Arduino based voting machine for entertainment

This code was written to create a physical voting system with live feedback
It's meant to be for interactive surveys.  On the wall, walk up and press a button
We put this together Thursday afternoon, October 18, 2012 
for the Hackfest at Access 2012 in Montreal, Quebec
We had a blast finding parts, building and coding.

This code was put together drawing from a few examples.
Thanks to the Sparkfun Arduino kit manual
