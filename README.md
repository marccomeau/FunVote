FunVote
=======

Arduino based voting machine for entertainment

This code was written to create a physical voting system with live feedback
It's meant to be for interactive surveys.  On the wall, walk up and press a button
We put this together Thursday afternoon, October 18, 2012 
for the Hackfest at Access 2012 in Montreal, Quebec
We had a blast finding parts, building and coding.
Thanks to ABRA Electronics http://www.abra-electronics.com/ 
for having all of the gear we needed to buy and being an overall awesome store
This code was put together drawing from a few examples.
Thanks to the Sparkfun Arduino kit manual
Thanks to Arduino tutorial http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/button
Thanks to Todd Holoubek's tutorial http://www.toddholoubek.com/classes/pcomp/?page_id=58

The code and schematic are prototypes for the concept 
We've added a picture to illustrate the concept which would use a large display of come sort
and hacked Staples Easy buttons or something of the same size as the input
